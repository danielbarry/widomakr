"*What wicked webs we weave.*"

WidoMakr is web discovery tool written in Java, a collection of tools for
quickly determining what information can be discovered and where potential
exploits may exist.

The tool has been designed to be operated via the terminal so that it may be
used easily with other tools to create powerful testing arsenals.
